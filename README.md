# Irrigation district water level spike detection

Code implementing spike detection algorithm for water level sensors for irrigation district SCADA data, implemented by the Australian National University and University of Melbourne as part of [One Basin CRC](https://onebasin.com.au/) project [Water infrastructure critical component anomaly detection and health prediction prototype](https://onebasin.com.au/project/water-infrastructure-critical-component-anomaly-detection-and-health-prediction-prototype/), licensed for public use under an MIT license.

Note that code is provided as is, and is not usable without necessary data.
